INTRODUCTION
What is MANET?
A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a selfconfiguring, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly. Each node in a MANET is free to move independently and can act as both a host and a router, forwarding data for other nodes.
Cont..
MANET is a decentralized wireless network consisting of mobile devices (nodes) that communicate with each other without relying on a fixed infrastructure,
MANETs are characterized by their dynamic topology, where nodes can move freely, causing frequent changes in the network structure
Key Characteristics of MANET
Dynamic Topologies: The network topology changes randomly and rapidly as nodes move. This can result in unidirectional or bidirectional links.
Bandwidth Constraints: Wireless links in MANETs typically have lower reliability, efficiency, and capacity compared to wired networks.
Autonomous Behavior: Each node acts as both a host and a router, forwarding traffic to other nodes,
Cont..
Energy Constraints: Nodes often rely on batteries, making energy conservation crucial.
Limited Security: MANETs are more susceptible to security threats due to their decentralized nature.
 
 
 
POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON MANET
❖Routing Attacks
These target the routing protocols, which are crucial in MANETs since every node also acts as a router.
Cont..
1. Black Hole Attack
A malicious node falsely advertises a shortest/optimal route to the destination.
Once data is routed through it, the node drops all packets (like a black hole).
 
 
 
Cont..
2. Wormhole Attack
Two attackers establish a tunnel between them, tricking nodes into thinking they are neighbors.
This disrupts normal routing and enables data interception or manipulation.
 
 
 
Cont..
3. Gray Hole Attack
Like Black Hole, but drops packets selectively, making it harder to detect.
 
Cont..
4. Rushing Attack
A node floods the network with route requests (RREQs) quickly to suppress legitimate ones.
It gets into many routing paths and can disrupt the network.
 
 
 
Cont..
5. Byzantine Attack
A group of compromised nodes collaborate to drop, modify, or misroute packets. 
POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON MANET
❖Impersonation & Spoofing Attacks
1. Sybil Attack
A single node presents multiple fake identities to gain influence in the network (e.g., in votingbased decisions or routing).
Cont..
2. Spoofing Attack
A node pretends to be another by spoofing its MAC or IP address, potentially hijacking traffic or causing misrouting.
Cont..
❖Eavesdropping & Passive Attacks
Attackers listen to communication without interfering.
Used to steal sensitive data or gather information for future attacks.
Cont..
❖Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks 1.  Jamming
The attacker floods the network with signals to disrupt wireless communication.
Cont..
2.  Flooding Attack
Sends excessive route requests (RREQs) or fake packets to consume resources and crash nodes.
Cont..
❖Information Disclosure & Replay Attacks 1. Replay Attack
An attacker captures a valid data transmission and replays it to trick nodes (e.g., replaying login info).
Summary
MANETs are vulnerable to both internal and external threats due to their decentralized, wireless, and open nature.
Main Categories:
1.Routing attacks
2.Impersonation attacks
3.Eavesdropping
4.Denial of Service (DoS)
5.Replay & passive attacks
